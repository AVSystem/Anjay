CoAP PULL download
------------------

If the LwM2M client needs to download a large file from an external CoAP server,
it may use the `anjay_download API <../api/download_8h.html>`_. The built-in
downloader supports both CoAP and CoAP/DTLS connections and is able to perform
transfers without interrupting regular LwM2M operations.

For a simple example, see `examples/tutorial/downloader` subdirectory of main
Anjay project repository.
