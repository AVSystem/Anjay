Enterprise-grade commercial support for the Anjay library, as well as additional
commercially-licensed library features, are provided by AVSystem. For more
details, see
`AVSystem Anjay website <https://www.avsystem.com/products/anjay/>`_.

If you want to test your LwM2M client implementation you can use the LwM2M
interoperability test module in AVSystem’s `Coiote IoT Device Management
<https://www.avsystem.com/products/coiote-iot-device-management-platform/>`_
platform. Our automated tests and testing scenarios enable you to quickly check
how interoperable your device is with LwM2M. The tests include basic actions,
such as Read, Write, Execute, Discover, Delete, and more as well as advanced
actions, such as Loop or Wait to build more complex test cases. What’s more,
you can also create your own test scenarios or have us prepare custom test cases
upon your request. Visit our `webpage
<https://www.avsystem.com/lwm2m-interoperability-test/>`_ to learn more.
