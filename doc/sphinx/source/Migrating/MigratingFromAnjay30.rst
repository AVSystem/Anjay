Migrating from Anjay 3.0
========================

.. contents:: :local:

.. highlight:: c

Introduction
------------

Since Anjay 3.0, some minor changes to the API has been done. These change are
breaking in the strictest sense, but in practice should not require any changes
to user code in typical usage.

Behavior of anjay_attr_storage_restore() upon failure
-----------------------------------------------------

Deprecated behavior of ``anjay_attr_storage_restore()`` which did clear the
Attribute Storage if supplied source stream was invalid has been changed. From
now on, if this function fails, the Attribute Storage remains untouched.
This change is breaking for code which relied on the old behavior, although
such code is unlikely.

Default (D)TLS version
----------------------

When the `anjay_configuration_t::dtls_version
<../api/structanjay__configuration.html#ab32477e7370a36e02db5b7e7ccbdd89d>`_
field is set to ``AVS_NET_SSL_VERSION_DEFAULT`` (which includes the case of
zero-initialization), Anjay 3.0 and earlier automatically mapped this setting to
``AVS_NET_SSL_VERSION_TLSv1_2`` to ensure that (D)TLS 1.2 is used as mandated by
the LwM2M specification.

This mapping has been removed in Anjay 3.1, which means that the default version
configuration of the underlying (D)TLS library will be used. This has been done
to automatically allow the use of newer protocols and deprecate old versions
when the backend library is updated, without the need to update Anjay code.
However, depending on the (D)TLS backend library used, this may lead to (D)TLS
1.1 or earlier being used if the server does not properly negotiate a higher
version. Please explicitly set ``dtls_version`` to
``AVS_NET_SSL_VERSION_TLSv1_2`` if you want to disallow this.

Please note that Mbed TLS 3.0 has dropped support for TLS 1.1 and earlier, so
this change will not affect behavior with that library.
