Porting guide for non-POSIX platforms
=====================================

By default, Anjay makes use of POSIX-specific interfaces for retrieving time
and handling network traffic. If no such interfaces are provided by the
toolchain, the user needs to provide custom implementations.


Time API
--------

If POSIX ``clock_gettime`` function is not available:

- Use ``WITH_POSIX_AVS_TIME=OFF`` when running CMake on Anjay,
- Provide an implementation for:

  - ``avs_time_real_now``
  - ``avs_time_monotonic_now``

.. note::
    For signatures and detailed description of listed functions, see
    `avs_commons <https://github.com/AVSystem/avs_commons/blob/master/utils/include_public/avsystem/commons/time.h>`_


Networking API
--------------

.. note::

    If LwIP 2.0 is used as a network stack, you may set:

     - ``-DWITH_POSIX_AVS_SOCKET=ON``
     - ``-DWITH_IPV6=OFF``
     - ``-DPOSIX_COMPAT_HEADER=avs_commons/git/compat/lwip-posix-compat.h``
    CMake options for an out-of-the-box socket compatibility layer implementation.

If POSIX socket API is not available:

- Use ``WITH_POSIX_AVS_SOCKET=OFF`` when running CMake on Anjay,
- Provide an implementation for:

  - ``_avs_net_create_udp_socket`` - a function with following signature:

    .. code-block:: c

        int _avs_net_create_udp_socket(avs_net_abstract_socket_t **socket,
                                       const void *socket_configuration);

    ``socket_configuration`` argument is a pointer to
    ``const avs_net_socket_configuration_t`` struct cast to ``void *``.

    The function should return 0 on success and a negative value on error.
    It should create a socket object, and return its pointer case to
    ``avs_net_abstract_socket_t *`` through the ``*socket`` argument.
    The socket object should be a struct, whose first field is
    ``avs_net_socket_v_table_t *`` filled with pointers to method handlers.

    Minimal set of socket methods that have to be implemented:

    - ``bind``
    - ``cleanup``
    - ``close``
    - ``connect``
    - ``create``
    - ``errno``
    - ``get_local_port``
    - ``get_opt`` able to read following options:

      - ``AVS_NET_SOCKET_OPT_STATE``
      - ``AVS_NET_SOCKET_OPT_MTU``
      - ``AVS_NET_SOCKET_OPT_INNER_MTU``
      - ``AVS_NET_SOCKET_OPT_RECV_TIMEOUT``

    - ``get_remote_host``
    - ``get_remote_hostname``
    - ``get_remote_port``
    - ``get_system``
    - ``receive``
    - ``send``
    - ``set_opt`` able to set the ``AVS_NET_SOCKET_OPT_RECV_TIMEOUT`` option


  - ``_avs_net_create_tcp_socket`` - only required if the ``fw_update`` module
    should support HTTP/HTTPS transfers. Otherwise, can be safely implemented as
    ``return -1;``.

    Function signature:

    .. code-block:: c

        int _avs_net_create_tcp_socket(avs_net_abstract_socket_t **socket,
                                       const void *socket_configuration);

    ``socket_configuration`` argument is a pointer to
    ``const avs_net_socket_configuration_t`` struct cast to ``void *``.

    The function should return 0 on success and a negative value on error.
    It should create a socket object, and return its pointer case to
    ``avs_net_abstract_socket_t *`` through the ``*socket`` argument.
    The socket object should be a struct, whose first field is
    ``avs_net_socket_v_table_t *`` filled with pointers to method handlers.

    Minimal set of socket methods that have to be implemented:

    - ``cleanup``
    - ``close``
    - ``connect``
    - ``create``
    - ``errno``
    - ``receive``
    - ``send``
    - ``set_opt`` able to set the ``AVS_NET_SOCKET_OPT_RECV_TIMEOUT`` option
    - ``shutdown``


.. warning::
    Anjay may attempt to call socket methods other than listed above, even
    though they are not essential for correct operation of the application.
    Make sure that all members of ``avs_net_socket_v_table_t`` are not NULL
    - if required, provide a stub that always fails.

.. note::

    `avs_commons <https://github.com/AVSystem/avs_commons/blob/master/net/include_public/avsystem/commons/net.h>`_
