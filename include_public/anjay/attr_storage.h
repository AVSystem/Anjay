/**
 * Installs the Attribute Storage handlers in an Anjay object, making it
 * possible to automatically manage attributes for LwM2M Objects, their
 * instances and resources.
 *
 * In accordance to the LwM2M specification, there are three levels on which
 * attributes may be stored:
 *
 * - Resource level (@ref anjay_dm_resource_read_attrs_t,
 *   @ref anjay_dm_resource_write_attrs_t)
 * - Instance level (@ref anjay_dm_instance_read_default_attrs_t,
 *   @ref anjay_dm_instance_write_default_attrs_t)
 * - Object level (@ref anjay_dm_object_read_default_attrs_t,
 *   @ref anjay_dm_object_write_default_attrs_t)
 *
 * If at least one of either read or write handlers is provided in a given
 * object for a given level, attribute handling on that level will not be
 * altered, but instead any calls will be directly forwarded to the original
 * handlers.
 *
 * If both read and write handlers are left as NULL in a given object for a
 * given level, attribute storage will be handled by the Attribute Storage
 * module instead, implementing both handlers.
 *
 * The Attribute Storage module does not require explicit cleanup; all resources
 * will be automatically freed up during the call to @ref anjay_delete.
 *
 * @param anjay ANJAY object for which the Attribute Storage is installed.
 *
 * @returns 0 on success, or a negative value in case of error.

 *
 * <strong>NOTE:</strong> For historical reasons, this function behaves
 * differently than all other <c>*_restore()</c> functions in Anjay in two ways:
 *
 * - On failed restoration, the storage is cleared, rather than left untouched
 * - Zero-length stream is treated as valid, and causes the storage to be
 *   cleared with success returned, instead of causing an error
 *
 * Relying on these behaviours is <strong>DEPRECATED</strong>. Future versions
 * of Anjay may change the semantics of this function so that it retains the
 * contents of Attribute Storage on failure, and does not treat empty streams as
 * valid. It is <strong>RECOMMENDED</strong> that any new code involving this
 * function is written to work properly with both semantics.
