OMA LwM2M - Brief description
=============================

.. contents:: :local:

`Lightweight Machine to Machine
<https://www.omaspecworks.org/what-is-oma-specworks/iot/lightweight-m2m-lwm2m/>`_
is a protocol developed by `OMA SpecWorks <https://omaspecworks.org/>`_ for
remote device management in the Internet of Things and other
Machine-to-Machine applications.

Initially LwM2M was designed to be transported either over UDP, or over SMS
directly in cellular phone networks. The next iteration of the standard, LwM2M
1.1, added support for another IP transport, TCP, and two more non-IP transports,
3GPP CIoT and LoRaWAN. All of these transports can be additionally secured with
use of (D)TLS.

The application data is encapsulated using the `Constrained Application Protocol
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7252>`_ (CoAP). CoAP is an application layer
protocol similar to HTTP in philosophy and general semantics, but designed
specifically with being lightweight in mind. CoAP makes it possible to transmit
messages with low overhead - the minimal header size is just 4 bytes, which makes
it feasible to send meaningful content within single, non-fragmented UDP
datagrams, even over links with low MTU, such as SMS.

Since LwM2M 1.1, CoAP messages can be additionally secured using `OSCORE
<https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8613>`_, an application layer protocol
with which it's possible to not only establish a secure communication channel
between LwM2M Clients and Servers, but also between the Client and external
applications. It's independent of security protocols used on other layers.

Anjay is designed to hide most of the protocol details from application
developers - however, a rudimentary understanding of the protocol is necessary
to understand the general philosophy and semantics of the parts that remain to
be implemented. You are encouraged to read the `full specification
<https://www.omaspecworks.org/what-is-oma-specworks/iot/lightweight-m2m-lwm2m/>`_,
but this article provides a quick summary of the most important concepts.

.. _clients-and-servers:

Clients and servers
-------------------

A network environment using the LwM2M protocol consists of three types of
entities:

- **LwM2M Clients** are located on end devices. They communicate with server(s),
  allowing them to manage and monitor the devices' resources, which are exposed
  via a standardized `data model`_.

  - A LwM2M Client is uniquely identified independently of its network address
    by an **Endpoint Client Name** - a URN uniquely assigned to a device by its
    manufacturer. OMA recommends the Endpoint Client Name to be in one of the
    following formats:

    - ``urn:uuid:########-####-####-############`` (UUID = Universally Unique
      Identifier)
    - ``urn:dev:ops:{OUI}-{ProductClass}-{SerialNumber}`` (OUI =
      Organizationally Unique Identifier - as in e.g. MAC addresses)
    - ``urn:dev:os:{OUI}-{SerialNumber}``
    - ``urn:imei:###############`` (IMEI = International Mobile Equipment
      Identity)
    - ``urn:esn:########`` (ESN = Electronic Serial Number)
    - ``urn:meid:##############`` (MEID = Mobile Equipment Identifier)
    - ``urn:imei-msisdn:###############-###############`` (MSISDN = Mobile
      Station International Subscriber Directory Number, i.e. a standardized
      phone number)

- **LwM2M Bootstrap Server** is a specific server that may be contacted by the
  Client during its first or every boot-up. Its only purpose is to initialize
  the data model, including connections to regular LwM2M Servers, before first
  contact to such. The Bootstrap Server communicates with the Client using a
  different set of commands, so it cannot be considered a "LwM2M Server" in the
  ordinary sense.

- **LwM2M Servers** maintain connections with the clients and have the ability
  to read from and write to the data model exposed by the clients. Any given
  client may be concurrently connected to more than one LwM2M Server, and each
  of them may have access only to a part of the whole data model.

Anjay is a framework for implementing LwM2M Clients. For this reason, the rest
of this article will be written from the Client perspective.

.. _data-model:

Data model
----------

Each LwM2M Client presents a *data model* - standardized, symbolic
representation of its configuration and state that is accessible for reading
and modifying by LwM2M Servers. It can be thought of as a combination of a
hierarchical configuration file, and a view on statistical information about the
device and its environment.

The LwM2M data model organized as a tree up to four levels deep. Entities on
each of those levels are identified with numerical identifiers, in range
0-65534, inclusive. A reserved value of 65535 (called ``MAX_ID`` in protocol's
specification) carries a special meaning in many contexts. Those levels
are:

- **Object** - each Object represent some different concept of data accessible
  via the LwM2M Client. For example, separate Objects are defined for managing
  connections with LwM2M Servers, for managing network connections, for
  accessing data from various types of sensors, etc.

  Each Object is assigned a unique numerical identifier. OMA manages a
  `registry of known Object IDs
  <https://technical.openmobilealliance.org/OMNA/LwM2M/LwM2MRegistry.html>`_.
  Each Object defines a set of Resources whose meanings are common for each
  Object Instance.

- **Object Instance** - some Objects are described as "single-instance" - such
  Objects always have exactly one Instance with identifier 0. Examples of such
  Objects include the Device object which describes the device itself, and the
  Firmware Update object which is used to perform firmware upgrades.

  Other Objects may have multiple Instances; sometimes the number of Instances
  may be variable and the Instances themselves may be creatable via LwM2M.
  Examples of such Objects include the Object that manages connections to LwM2M
  Servers, Object that represents optional software packages installed on the
  device, and Objects representing sensors (whose instances are, however, not
  creatable).

- **Resource** - each Object Instance of a given Object supports the same set
  of Resources, as defined by the Object definition. Within a given Object,
  each Resource ID has a well-defined meaning, and represent the same concept.
  However, some Resources may not be present in some Object Instances, and,
  obviously, their values and mapping onto real-world entities may be different.

- **Resource Instance** - some Resources may have multiple instances (they're
  sometimes called *Multiple-Resources*), effectively causing the type of that
  resource to be an associative array with an integer index. Since LwM2M 1.1,
  instances of these resources may be addressed individually.

The numerical identifiers on each of these levels form a path, which is used
as the path portion of CoAP URLs. For example, a path ``/9/2/17/3`` refers to
Resource Instance ID=3 of Resource ID=17 in Object Instance ID=2 of Object
ID=9. Whole Resources (``/9/2/17``), Object Instances (``/9/2``) or even
Objects (``/9``) may be referred to using this syntax as well.

Objects
^^^^^^^

Each Object definition, which may be found in the LwM2M specification, features
the following information:

- **Name** - description of the object; it is not used in the actual on-wire
  protocol.

- **Object ID** - numerical identifier of the Object

- **Instances** - *Single* (always has one Instance with ID=0) or *Multiple*
  (may have arbitrary number of Instances depending on current configuration)

- **Mandatory** - *Mandatory* (must be supported by all LwM2M Client
  implementations) or *Optional* (may not be supported)

- **Object URN**

- Resource definitions

The current set of Mandatory Objects consists of:

- ``/0`` - **LwM2M Security** - contains confidential part of information about
  connections to the LwM2M Servers configured in the Client. From the on-wire
  protocol perspective, it is write-only and accessible only via the
  `Bootstrap Interface`_. Implementation of this object is readily available in
  Anjay's ``security`` module.

- ``/1`` - **LwM2M Server** - contains non-confidential part of information
  about connections to the LwM2M Servers configured in the Client.
  Implementation of this object is readily available in Anjay's ``server``
  module.

- ``/3`` - **Device** - contains basic information about the device, such as
  e.g. serial number.

Additionally, Object ``/2`` (**Access Control**) needs to be supported and
present if the Client supports more than one LwM2M Server connection at once.
Implementation of this object is readily available in Anjay's ``access_control``
module.

.. _lwm2m-resources:

Resources
^^^^^^^^^

Each of the Resource definitions, contained in each Object definition, features
the following information:

- **ID** - numerical identifier of the Resource.

- **Name** - short description of the resource; it is not used in the actual
  on-wire protocol.

- **Operations** - one of:

  - **R** - read-only Resource
  - **W** - write-only Resource
  - **RW** - writeable Resource
  - **E** - executable Resource
  - *(empty)* - used only in the LwM2M Security Object; signifies a Resource not
    accessible via the `Device Management and Service Enablement Interface`_

- **Instances** - *Single* or *Multiple*; "Multiple" means that the type of data
  in the resource is actually an "array" - called such in the Anjay API, but
  actually more similar to an associative data structure. It is a list of pairs,
  each of which containing a unique Resource Instance ID (range 0-65535,
  inclusive) and instance value, of the type referred in the Resource
  definition.

- **Mandatory** - *Mandatory* or *Optional*; Mandatory resources need to be
  present in all Instances on all devices. Optional resources may not be present
  in all Instances, and may even be not supported at all on some Clients.

- **Type** - data type of the Resource value (or its instances in case of
  Multiple Resources).

- **Range or Enumeration** - specification of valid values for the Resource,
  within the given data type.

- **Units** - units in which a numerical value is given.

- **Description** - detailed description of the resource.

.. _lwm2m-attributes:

Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^

Each entity in the data model (Object, Object Instance, Resource or Resource
Instance) can have various "attributes" attached. Most of these attributes are
handled automatically by Anjay. There are two types of attributes currently
defined in the LwM2M specification:

- **<PROPERTIES>** Class Attributes are read-only metadata that may be read by
  Servers without accessing the data itself, possibly allowing it to operate
  more effectively. These include:

  - **Dimension** (``dim``) - in case of Multiple Resources, it is the number of
    Resource Instances.

  - **Object Version** (``ver``) - provides a way for versioning Object
    definitions. This attribute, if not present, implies 1.0 version of the
    Object, although the user is free to adjust it in ``anjay_dm_object_def_t``
    structure.

  - additional properties used only in Bootstrap-Discover operation: **Short
    Server ID** (``ssid``) and **Server URI** (``uri``).

- **<NOTIFICATION>** Class Attributes are writeable by LwM2M Servers and affect
  the way changes in observed resources are notified over the
  `Information Reporting Interface`_.

  By default, *Notify* messages are sent each time there is some change to the
  value of the queried path (which may be a Resource, or all Resources within a
  given Object Instance or Object, if the Observe request was called on such
  higher-level path).

  This behavior can be modified using the following available attributes:

  - **Minimum Period** (``pmin``) - if set to a non-zero value, notifications
    will never be sent more often than once every ``pmin`` seconds.

  - **Maximum Period** (``pmax``) - if set, notifications will *always* be sent
    at least once every ``pmax`` seconds, even if the value did not change.

  - **Greater Than** (``gt``) and **Less Than** (``lt``) - applicable only to
    numeric Resources - if set, notifications will only be sent when the value
    changes from below to above or from above to below the specified threshold.
    Contrary to what the names of these Attributes might suggest, there is no
    semantic difference between the two - both behave as equivalent
    bi-directional thresholds.

  - **Step** (``st``) - applicable only to numeric Resources - if set,
    notifications will only be sent if the numerical value is different from the
    previously notified value by at least ``st``.

  - **Minimum Evaluation Period** (``epmin``) - if set, the notification
    criteria won't be evaluated more often than every ``epmin`` seconds.

  - **Maximum Evaluation Period** (``epmax``) - if set, the notification
    criteria will be evaluated at least every ``epmax`` seconds (although this
    attribute is ignored in Anjay, as the automatic evaluation happens when
    ``pmax`` seconds pass).

  When several Attributes are specified at the same time, the relations between
  them are as follows:

  - ``pmin`` and ``pmax`` have higher priority - even if the requirements for
    ``gt``, ``lt`` and ``st`` are not met, a notification will always be sent
    at least once every ``pmax`` seconds - and conversely, even when the
    requirements for ``gt``, ``lt`` and ``st`` are met, a notification will
    never be sent more often than once every ``pmin`` seconds.

  - Requirements for just at least one of ``gt``, ``lt`` or ``st`` need to be
    met if they are set at the same time. For example, if the new value differs
    by at least ``st`` from the previously sent one, it does not need to cross
    either of the ``lt``/``gt`` thresholds - the ``st`` condition alone is
    enough to trigger sending notification.

Interfaces
----------

LwM2M currently consists of four interfaces through which the Clients, Servers
and Bootstrap Servers communicate:

- `Bootstrap Interface`_
- `Registration Interface`_
- `Device Management and Service Enablement Interface`_
- `Information Reporting Interface`_

Bootstrap Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bootstrap Interface defines the set of commands that the Bootstrap Server may
use to provision the initial configuration onto the client. In this interface,
both the LwM2M Client and the LwM2M Bootstrap Server act as both a CoAP server
and a CoAP client. The messages that may be exchanged between those include:

- **POST /bs?ep={Endpoint Client Name}** request sent from the Client to the
  Bootstrap Server signifies a **Bootstrap Request** command. It informs the
  Bootstrap Server that a new client has appeared on the network and is
  requesting bootstrap information. However, the protocol also allows the
  Bootstrap Server to start issuing Bootstrap commands on its own, without
  receiving a Bootstrap Request message.

- **GET Accept: application/link-format** request sent from the Bootstrap Server
  to the Client is interpreted as **Bootstrap Discover**. It allows the
  Bootstrap Server to get information about the data model supported by and
  present on the client device.

- **GET** with *Content Format* option sent from the Bootstrap Server to the
  Client is a **Bootstrap Read**. It can be used to read LwM2M Server and Access
  Control Objects during the Bootstrap phase to query for already configured
  Servers on the Client.

- **PUT** requests sent from the Bootstrap Server to the Client are interpreted
  as **Bootstrap Write** commands. These allow creating and writing to Object
  Instances and Resources in order to initialize the data model to a state
  appropriate for communication with regular LwM2M Servers.

- **Bootstrap Delete** command, represented as **DELETE** requests from the
  Bootstrap Server to the Client, allows the Bootstrap Server to delete existing
  Object Instances.

- Finally, the Bootstrap Server sends a **Bootstrap Finish** command,
  represented as a **POST /bs** CoAP request send to the Client. Upon receiving
  it, the Client validates the data model, and in case of success, connects to
  regular LwM2M Servers, according to the configured stored within the data
  model.

As you can see, the Bootstrap Interface is mostly write-only. The Bootstrap
Server is not able to do any actual management or monitoring of the Client. It
can only prepare it for communication with regular LwM2M Servers. Nevertheless,
nothing prevents Bootstrap Server and regular Server applications from
coexisting on the same host.

The Bootstrap Server is the only entity that can manage connections to
LwM2M Servers on a Client via the LwM2M protocol itself. For this reason, an
association with a Bootstrap Server may be maintained indefinitely - however,
the protocol also provides an option to permanently disconnect from the
Bootstrap Server after a successful bootstrap.

Bootstrap information may also be provided by means other than the Bootstrap
Server. The protocol also allows the bootstrap information to be pre-provisioned
at the factory, or read from a smart-card. In those cases, an attempt to contact
a Bootstrap Server may not even be made.

.. _lwm2m-registration-interface:

Registration Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Registration Interface defines the protocol the Client uses to inform an
LwM2M Server about its presence and availability. In this interface, the LwM2M
Server acts as a CoAP server, and the LwM2M Client is a CoAP client. The
requests that may be sent from the Client to the Server include:

- **Register**, represented as a CoAP **POST /rd?...** request, is initially
  sent by the Client when it goes online. It informs the Server that the Client
  is available for receiving commands on the
  `Device Management and Service Enablement Interface`_ and the
  `Information Reporting Interface`_, and presents it with basic metadata
  describing its data model. It also gives the server the IP address and port
  (or phone number, in case of SMS transport) on which the Client is accessible
  - these are taken directly from the source fields in IP and UDP layer headers.

- **Update**, which is a CoAP **POST** request on an URL previously returned in
  a response to *Register*. **Update** is sent in following situations:

  - periodically - to ensure the Server that the device is still online,

  - whenever any of the information previously given in a Register message
    changes - so that the Server always has up-to-date information about the
    Client's state.

- **De-register** (CoAP **DELETE**) may be sent by the Client if it can
  determine that it is shutting down. It terminates the association between
  the Client and Server. Sending it is, however, not required, as the Server
  will also consider the association terminated if the Client does not report
  with a Register or Update message for a configured period of time.

Device Management and Service Enablement Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the main interface on which the actual device management occurs. In this
interface, most of the requests are made by the LwM2M Server, that is, it acts as
a CoAP client, sending requests to the LwM2M Client, which acts as a server on
the CoAP layer. The exception is the **Send** request (available since LwM2M
1.1), which is issued by the LwM2M Client. Please note that the IP addresses and
port numbers are exactly the same as previously established via the `Registration
Interface`_ - it means that for given two endpoints, the client/server
relationship on the CoAP layer is reversible at any time.

Following operations can be issued by the LwM2M Server:

- **Discover** (CoAP **GET Accept: application/link-format**) allows the Server
  to get a list of all supported and present Objects, Object Instances and
  Resources, and to read Attributes_ attached to them. Data stored in Resources
  is not returned.

- **Read** (CoAP **GET** other than the above) reads data - either from a single
  Resource Instance, entire Resource, Object Instance, or even a whole Object
  at once.

- **Write** allows the Server to modify the data model. It comes in two
  flavors:

  - **PUT /{Object ID}/{Instance ID}[/{Resource ID}[/{Resource Instance ID}]]**
    request signifies the *Replace* method. It can be called on either a single
    Resource to replace its value, or on a whole Object Instance - in that case
    all existing contents of that Instance are erased and replaced with the
    supplied data.

  - **POST /{Object ID}/{Instance ID}** request means *Partial Update*. It can
    only be called on a whole Object Instance and only replaces the Resources
    present in the request payload, retaining other previously existing data.

  Both methods require the *Content-Format* option to be included in the
  request.

  Anjay attempts to abstract away the difference between the two. All such bulk
  writes are translated to series of writes on single values. However, to
  properly support the *Replace* semantics, an additional virtual operation
  called *Reset* is introduced, called before the series of writes during a
  *Replace* and intended to revert the Object Instance to its initial, empty
  state.

- While most entities in the data model are designed to be read and written,
  a given entity may alternatively be specified as supporting the **Execute**
  operation, represented by a **POST /{Object ID}/{Instance ID}/{Resource ID}**
  request. Execute operation is introduced in the data model wherever a way is
  necessary to instruct the device to perform some non-idempotent operation such
  as a reboot or a firmware upgrade.

- A **PUT** request *without* a *Content-Format* option is interpreted as
  **Write Attributes**. The Attributes are passed as query string elements in
  the target URL. These Attributes mostly alter the way the Client behaves in
  relation to the `Information Reporting Interface`_ and are explained in detail
  in the Attributes_ section.

- A **POST** request targeting one of the root paths in the data model (called
  "Objects", see `Data model`_) represents the **Create** operation. It creates
  a new Object Instance, which gives a way to manage configuration entities that
  might have a variable and configurable number of similar but distinct entries
  - for example, software packages or APN connections.

- Composite counterparts of **Read** and **Write** operations -
  **Read-Composite** (CoAP **FETCH**) and **Write-Composite** (CoAP **iPATCH**),
  which can target many Object Instances and Resources of different Objects.
  These operations were added in LwM2M 1.1.

- Finally, the **Delete** operation (CoAP **DELETE**) is the reverse of Create,
  allowing to remove previously created Object Instances.

Following operations can be issued by the LwM2M Client:

- A **POST /dp** request represents the **Send** operation. It's used by the
  Client to send data to the Server without an explicit request, which is in
  some circumstances a more flexible option compared to the standard Information
  Reporting Interface described further.

Information Reporting Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This interface can be thought of as an extension to the
`Device Management and Service Enablement Interface`_, allowing the Server to
automatically receive periodic updates about some values in the data model it is
particularly interested in. It is based on the
`OBSERVE extension to CoAP <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7641>`_, applying its
semantics mostly unchanged onto the LwM2M mapping of CoAP concepts.

- A *Read* operation (CoAP **GET**), after adding the **Observe option = 0**,
  becomes **Observe**. Upon receiving such request, in addition to returning the
  current value, the Client will start sending *Notify* messages when
  appropriate.

- **Cancel Observation** command can be issued either by performing a *Read*
  with **Observe option = 1** or by responding to the *Notify* message with a
  **CoAP RESET**.

- Composite counterparts of **Observe** and **Cancel Observation** operations -
  **Observe-Composite** (CoAP **FETCH** with **Observe option = 0**) and
  **Cancel Observation-Composite** (CoAP **FETCH** with **Observe option = 1**),
  which can target many entities at once.

- **Notify** is an **asynchronous CoAP response** as described in
  `RFC 7641 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7641>`_. It is essentially a
  repeated reply to a *Read*, sent whenever the observed value changes, and/or
  periodically, according to relevant Attributes_.

  It may be sent as a Non-confirmable or as a Confirmable message at discretion
  of the Client. Anjay currently sends almost all notifications as
  Non-confirmable messages; Confirmable notifications are sent once every 24
  hours, to comply with
  `RFC 7641 section 4.5 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7641#page-18>`_.

Queue mode
----------

The *Register* command includes a "Queue Mode" parameter which indicates if
the client device is running in Queue Mode. It's a special mode of operation
in which the client device is not required to actively listen for incoming
packets. The client is only required to listen for such packets for a limited
period of time after each exchange of messages with the Server - typically
after the *Update* command.

The specification recommends to use CoAP's ``MAX_TRANSMIT_WAIT`` value (93
seconds by default) as that aforementioned limited period of time, and this
recommendation is respected in Anjay.

Anjay automatically handles the queue mode by hiding connections which are not
required to actively listen from the library user. In particular, if the
``anjay_get_sockets()`` function returns an empty list, it likely means that all
active connections are in queue mode and the listening period has passed. In
that case, it is safe to passively sleep for the period returned by
``anjay_sched_time_to_next()`` (or one of its convenience wrappers).

In LwM2M 1.0 the use of Queue Mode was handled by Binding parameter, included
in *Register* and *Update* commands.

Trigger mode
------------

SMS messages can be used not only just a sole communication method for
LwM2M-enabled devices, but they can be also used in coordination with any other
binding to wake the device up from sleep in Queue Mode and send the Update
message to the Server. This mode of operation is called "Trigger mode".

To wake the device up, the LwM2M Server sends the Execute operation on ``1/x/8``
Resource (*Registration Update Trigger*), expecting a response to that message
on the other communication channel, like TCP or UDP.

You can find more information about Trigger mode in :ref:`SMS Binding feature
description <anjay-sms-trigger-mode>`.

In LwM2M 1.0, similar mode of operation could be achieved with use of "UQS"
Binding Mode.
