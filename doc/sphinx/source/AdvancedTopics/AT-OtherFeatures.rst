CoAP PULL download
------------------

If the LwM2M Client needs to download a large file from an external CoAP server,
it may use the `anjay_download API <../api/download_8h.html>`_. The built-in
downloader supports CoAP, CoAP/DTLS and HTTP(S) connections and is able to
perform transfers without interrupting regular LwM2M operations.

For a simple example, see `examples/tutorial/AT-Downloader` subdirectory of main
Anjay project repository.
