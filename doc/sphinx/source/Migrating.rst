Migrating from older versions
=============================

.. note::

    Each of these documents is intended to be stand-alone and complete guide for
    migrating from the specified version to the newest one.

    In other words, if you are migrating from e.g. Anjay 2.4, you **only** need
    to follow :doc:`Migrating/MigratingFromAnjay24`. All the relevant
    information from :doc:`Migrating/MigratingFromAnjay26` etc. is included
    there as well.
