 * 2. If there were changes to the Security object, removes all ACL entries
 *    (i.e., ACL Resource Instances) that refer to SSIDs of Servers who are no

 *    those Access Control object instances which have multiple ACL entries, or
 *    removal of instances for which the ACL would be empty. In the latter case,
 *    the referred Object Instances are removed as well (see LwM2M TS 1.0.2,
 *    E.1.3 Unbootstrapping).
 * 3. Creates new Access Control object instances that refer to all newly
 *    created Object Instances. These will have the owner and the default ACL
 *    referring to SSID == <c>origin_ssid</c> parameter.
 *
 * Please refer to comments inside the implementation for details.
