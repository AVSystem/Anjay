/**
 * Performs implicit creations and deletions of Access Control object instances
 * according to data model changes.
 *
 * Specifically, it performs three steps:
 *
 * 1. Removes all Access Control object instances that refer to Object Instances
 *    that have been removed from the data model.
 * 2. If there were changes to the Security object, removes all ACL entries
 *    (i.e., ACL Resource Instances) that refer to SSIDs of Servers who are no
 *    longer repesented in the data model. This may cause changing the owner of
 *    those Access Control object instances which have multiple ACL entries, or
 *    removal of instances for which the ACL would be empty. In the latter case,
 *    the referred Object Instances are removed as well (see LwM2M TS 1.0.2,
 *    E.1.3 Unbootstrapping).
 * 3. Creates new Access Control object instances that refer to all newly
 *    created Object Instances. These will have the owner and the default ACL
 *    referring to SSID == _anjay_dm_current_ssid(anjay).
 *
 * Please refer to comments inside the implementation for details.
