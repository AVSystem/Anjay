Enrollment over Secure Transport
================================

.. contents:: :local:

General description
-------------------

**Enrollment over Secure Transport** (EST, `RFC 7030
<https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7030>`_), to quote its specification,
is a certificate management protocol targeting Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
clients that need to acquire client certificates and associated Certification
Authority (CA) certificates.  It also supports client-generated public/private
key pairs as well as key pairs generated by the CA.

**EST-coaps** (`draft-ietf-ace-coap-est-18
<https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-ace-coap-est-18>`_, also
referenced in the LwM2M Core TS) is a protocol that uses CoAP instead of HTTP
for message exchanges, which allows constrained, low-resource devices to use
existing EST functionality for provisioning certificates.

An implementation of the **EST-coaps client** is provided as a commercial
feature in Anjay. This enhances security provided by the (D)TLS Certificate
mode, by allowing the device to generate a key pair locally, with the private
key never leaving the device, as well as allowing the server to update the
device's PKIX trust store without a full firmware update.

By using the EST-coaps protocol, you can:

* Achieve the highest level of security available for the LwM2M protocol,
  especially when paired with Hardware Security Module support

  * The chain of trust for client and server certificates can be configured in a
    more robust way than with the standard Certificate mode

  * Generating client keys on the device means that they do not leak even if the
    server is compromised

* Make key enrollment procedures in production environments streamlined, simpler
  and more scalable

  * Only the bootstrap credentials need to be provided at manufacture time,
    while keys for the main credentials can be provisioned remotely at first use

  * Thanks to standardized means of updating the trust store, including
    certificate revocation lists, there are more options for updating the
    security credentials and handling cases of compromised keys

Supported features
------------------

The following features are implemented:

* Distribution of CA Certificates (``/est/crts``), supporting both a single raw
  X.509 certificate and PKCS#7 cert-only as response payload formats
* Enrollment of Clients (``/est/sen``), supporting both raw X.509 and PKCS#7
  cert-only as response payload formats
* Re-enrollment of Clients (``/est/sren``) - the client certificate validity
  time is tracked and the ``/est/sren`` request is issued automatically when the
  certificate is nearing expiration, with the exact amount of time being
  configurable
* The keys and certificates can be stored in local memory, processed in software
  and persisted to local non-volatile storage, or processed and stored by the
  Hardware Security Module (requires HSM integration code, some are available as
  additional commercial features)

It is assumed that the same CoAP endpoint is used as both the LwM2M Bootstrap
Server and the EST-coaps server.

Technical documentation
-----------------------

Enabling EST support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If support for EST is available in your version of Anjay, it can be enabled at
compile time by enabling the ``ANJAY_WITH_EST`` macro in the ``anjay_config.h``
file or, if using CMake, enabling the corresponding ``WITH_EST`` CMake option.

When enabled at compile time, EST support will be automatically available.
However, for the EST requests to be made, the following conditions must be met:

* LwM2M Bootstrap Server Account must exist; EST requests (other than
  ``/est/sren``) are only performed after receiving the Bootstrap Finish
  request over the Bootstrap interface (see also:
  :doc:`../AdvancedTopics/AT-CustomObjects/AT_CO_BootstrapAwareness`)
* At least one LwM2M Server Account (provisioned by the Bootstrap Server) must
  be configured with the Security Mode resource (``/0/*/2``) set to 4
  (Certificate mode with EST).

Please note that the EST-coaps specification requires that the connection used
for EST requests (which is the Bootstrap Server Account in case of LwM2M) is
configured to use the certificate mode as well. Anjay does not enforce this
requirement, but some LwM2M Bootstrap Servers (including Coiote DM from
AVSystem) may refuse performing EST operations over a transport that does not
use certificates. See :doc:`../AdvancedTopics/AT-Certificates` for more
information on configuring certificate-based security.

You may additionally set the Bootstrap Server Account to use the
``ANJAY_SECURITY_EST`` mode instead of ``ANJAY_SECURITY_CERTIFICATE``, which
will enable the use of EST-provisioned client certificate for subsequent
connections to the bootstrap server (the certificate from the data model is used
otherwise).

In this default configuration, the EST subsystem will use the following
configuration:

* ``/est/sren`` requests are issued 30 days before the certificate expiration
  date, or after 90% of the time between its provisioning and expiration dates
  has passed, whichever is later,
* ``/est/crts`` requests are performed if there is at least one Server Account
  provisioned to use the EST mode; the resulting trust store is additionally
  used for subsequent connections with the Bootstrap Server as well,
* keys and certificates provisioned using EST are stored in local memory and
  processed in software.

These settings can be changed when initializing the Anjay object, see the
:ref:`cf-est-config` section for details.

.. important::

    For EST logic to work properly across restarts of the client application,
    persistence of EST state needs to be implemented. This is explained in the
    section below.

Persisting EST state
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

   The full code for the following example can be found in the
   ``examples/commercial-features/CF-EST`` directory in Anjay sources. Note that
   to compile and run it, you need to have access to a commercial version of
   Anjay that includes the EST feature.

The EST state needs to be kept in sync with the state of the Security object, so
it is usually a good idea to store those two blocks of data in the same place.
Thus, the persist and restore routines from the
:doc:`../AdvancedTopics/AT-Persistence` tutorial can be extended as follows:

.. highlight:: c
.. snippet-source:: examples/commercial-features/CF-EST/src/main.c
    :emphasize-lines: 16-19

    if (avs_is_err(anjay_security_object_persist(anjay, file_stream))) {
        avs_log(tutorial, ERROR, "Could not persist Security Object");
        goto finish;
    }

    if (avs_is_err(anjay_server_object_persist(anjay, file_stream))) {
        avs_log(tutorial, ERROR, "Could not persist Server Object");
        goto finish;
    }

    if (avs_is_err(anjay_attr_storage_persist(anjay, file_stream))) {
        avs_log(tutorial, ERROR, "Could not persist LwM2M attribute storage");
        goto finish;
    }

    if (avs_is_err(anjay_est_state_persist(anjay, file_stream))) {
        avs_log(tutorial, ERROR, "Could not persist EST state");
        goto finish;
    }

.. highlight:: c
.. snippet-source:: examples/commercial-features/CF-EST/src/main.c
    :emphasize-lines: 16-19

    if (avs_is_err(anjay_security_object_restore(anjay, file_stream))) {
        avs_log(tutorial, ERROR, "Could not restore Security Object");
        goto finish;
    }

    if (avs_is_err(anjay_server_object_restore(anjay, file_stream))) {
        avs_log(tutorial, ERROR, "Could not restore Server Object");
        goto finish;
    }

    if (avs_is_err(anjay_attr_storage_restore(anjay, file_stream))) {
        avs_log(tutorial, ERROR, "Could not restore LwM2M attribute storage");
        goto finish;
    }

    if (avs_is_err(anjay_est_state_restore(anjay, file_stream))) {
        avs_log(tutorial, ERROR, "Could not restore EST state");
        goto finish;
    }

In the example, the state is persisted when exiting the application, but it
might be a good idea to do it periodically or after each change. The
`anjay_est_state_is_ready_for_persistence()
<../api/core_8h.html#a02394aecc7e6c616ced0ed6157da8ff7>`_ function can be useful
for this purpose. It is intended to be used in a similar manner to functions
such as `anjay_security_object_is_modified()
<../api/security_8h.html#a25a9fbd4f84f05a8a2ce50f526c7bc77>`_, however it will
also return ``false`` if EST operation is in progress, because in contrast to
data model objects, the EST state cannot be rolled back.

The simplest way to use these functions would be to skip persisting data if
there is no new data ready to be persisted:

.. highlight:: c
.. snippet-source:: examples/commercial-features/CF-EST/src/main.c
    :emphasize-lines: 4

    if ((!anjay_security_object_is_modified(anjay)
         && !anjay_server_object_is_modified(anjay)
         && !anjay_attr_storage_is_modified(anjay))
            || !anjay_est_state_is_ready_for_persistence(anjay)) {
        avs_log(tutorial, INFO,
                "Persistence not necessary - NOT persisting objects");
        return 0;
    }

However, please take note of the following warning:

.. important::

    If ``anjay_est_state_is_ready_for_persistence()`` returns ``false``, the
    subsequent call to ``anjay_est_state_persist()`` will return an error. This
    error needs to be handled, and to make sure that *some* valid data is
    persisted, you should make sure that the original state of the persistence
    file (or flash memory block, etc.) is restored in that case.

    In the example, this is done by never calling
    ``anjay_est_state_is_ready_for_persistence()`` in such a situation.

.. important::

    Unless :ref:`HSM-based security <cf-est-hsm>` is used, the persistence
    stream **will contain cryptographic credentials, including private keys**.
    Please consider this when choosing the storage location for this data.

.. _cf-est-config:

Configuring EST behavior
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The EST example also contains a sample non-default configuration of the EST
subsystem:

.. highlight:: c
.. snippet-source:: examples/commercial-features/CF-EST/src/main.c
    :emphasize-lines: 7-14

    const anjay_configuration_t CONFIG = {
        .endpoint_name = argv[1],
        .in_buffer_size = 4000,
        .out_buffer_size = 4000,
        .msg_cache_size = 4000,

        .trust_store_certs = avs_crypto_certificate_chain_info_from_file(
                "/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt"),
        .est_reenroll_config = &(const anjay_est_reenroll_config_t) {
            .enable = true,
            .nominal_usage = 0.8,
            .max_margin = avs_time_duration_from_scalar(7, AVS_TIME_DAY)
        },
        .est_cacerts_policy = ANJAY_EST_CACERTS_FOR_EST_SECURITY
    };

    g_anjay = anjay_new(&CONFIG);

Here's a quick description of the settings used:

* `trust_store_certs
  <../api/structanjay__configuration.html#a6eb46a8b375d73a4c2fb609ac17748db>`_
  is not strictly related to EST, but it can be used to configure the initial
  trust store for use when the `Certificate Usage field
  <http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/LightweightM2M/V1_2-20201110-A/HTML-Version/OMA-TS-LightweightM2M_Transport-V1_2-20201110-A.html#5-2-9-7-0-5297-Certificate-Usage-Field>`_
  (see also: `anjay_security_instance_t::certificate_usage
  <../api/structanjay__security__instance__t.html#ac972ac4a1d3ff7ea8501c31f08773d4c>`_)
  is set to 0 or 1, used before a new one is obtained via ``/est/crts``

  * See also related: `use_system_trust_store
    <../api/structanjay__configuration.html#a84b693c1bb9e83bbf67a0a9b304d5e88>`_
    and `trust_store_crls
    <../api/structanjay__configuration.html#aa0a29edbd09fca4542ac146b39663657>`_

* `est_reenroll_config
  <../api/structanjay__configuration.html#af360bcadeb344ff6d1b27451920515cc>`_
  can be set to change the default schedule of performing the ``/est/sren``
  requests; detailed semantics of its fields are available in the
  `anjay_est_reenroll_config_t Struct Reference
  <../api/structanjay__est__reenroll__config__t.html>`_

  * The settings in the example mean that the new certificate is requested
    7 days before its expiry date, or after 80% of its validity period have
    passeed, whichever comes later

* `est_cacerts_policy
  <api/structanjay__configuration.html#aa77f9d5291f4bee4d92efaebe02f5a4c>`_
  allows changing the details on when the ``/est/crts`` request is performed
  and what the provisioned trust store is used for; detailed semantics of each
  available mode is available in the `anjay_est_cacerts_policy_t Enum Reference
  <../api/core_8h.html#a150879e082c4c2355393dab23bacddba>`_

.. _cf-est-hsm:

Using EST with hardware security modules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

   The full code for the following example can be found in the
   ``examples/commercial-features/CF-EST-PKCS11`` directory in Anjay sources.
   Note that to compile and run it, you need to have access to a commercial
   version of Anjay that includes the EST and HSM features.

When Anjay also has the hardware security module support (available as a
separate commercial feature) compiled in, the EST module can easily be
configured to use it for generating and storing the security credentials.

The variant of the example application that uses PKCS#11 hardware cryptography
engine specifies additional fields in the ``anjay_configuration_t`` structure:

.. highlight:: c
.. snippet-source:: examples/commercial-features/CF-EST-PKCS11/src/main.c
    :emphasize-lines: 20-25

    char EST_CACERTS_ADDRESS_BUF[256];

    srand(time(NULL));

    const anjay_configuration_t CONFIG = {
        .endpoint_name = argv[1],
        .in_buffer_size = 4000,
        .out_buffer_size = 4000,
        .msg_cache_size = 4000,

        .trust_store_certs = avs_crypto_certificate_chain_info_from_file(
                "/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt"),
        .est_reenroll_config = &(const anjay_est_reenroll_config_t) {
            .enable = true,
            .nominal_usage = 0.8,
            .max_margin = avs_time_duration_from_scalar(7, AVS_TIME_DAY)
        },
        .est_cacerts_policy = ANJAY_EST_CACERTS_FOR_EST_SECURITY,

        .est_engine_key_address =
                "pkcs11:token=MyToken;object=EstClientKey;pin-value=1234",
        .est_engine_cert_address =
                "pkcs11:token=MyToken;object=EstClientCert;pin-value=1234",
        .est_engine_cacerts_address_gen_cb = est_crts_address_gen,
        .est_engine_cacerts_address_gen_cb_arg = EST_CACERTS_ADDRESS_BUF
    };

.. important::

    The "addresses" (also sometimes referred to as "query strings") in this
    example are PKCS#11 URIs. However, the format of these strings is
    dependent on the hardware security engine used. Please refer to the
    documentation of the module you're using (PKCS#11, PSA, IoT SAFE etc.), or
    its implementation if you have implemented one yourself.

.. highlight:: none

.. note::

    When the examples are compiled automatically (e.g. using
    ``make commercial_feature_examples``), the Anjay library is configured to
    use the PKCS#11 backend.

    To run it, the PKCS#11 module library needs to be specified via the
    ``PKCS11_MODULE_PATH`` environment variable, for example::

        env PKCS11_MODULE_PATH=/usr/lib/softhsm/libsofthsm2.so ./anjay-est-pkcs11 {endpoint-name}

Here's a quick description of the settings used:

* `est_engine_key_address
  <../api/structanjay__configuration.html#abbcfd5912e1138f4576509c500ed1a9a>`_
  specifies the address at which the client's private key will be generated
  during the EST enrollment process

  * Note: in case of PKCS#11, two objects will be generated, separate for the
    private and public keys; these will share the same label

* `est_engine_cert_address
  <../api/structanjay__configuration.html#aecdf44d9bd9d87fbdca6672d6f9aaf11>`_
  specifies the address at which the client's public certificate will be stored
  after having been provisioned by the EST server

* `est_engine_cacerts_address_gen_cb
  <../api/structanjay__configuration.html#abc4fdd9feb2cb58a47408a96308dbf6e>`_
  is set to a pointer to the function that will be used for generating addresses
  at which the trusted certificates provisioned via the ``/est/crts`` operation
  will be stored

  * This generation function is necessary because there might be multiple
    trusted certificates, so a single address is not sufficient

  * `est_engine_cacerts_address_gen_cb_arg
    <../api/structanjay__configuration.html#a695689ab4fc248793ad63f631a0c630f>`_
    can be used to specify any opaque argument that will be passed to that
    function; in this example it points to a buffer that will be used to store
    the generated addresses, but you are free to use this argument in any way
    you wish

  * In this example application, the following function is used:

    .. highlight:: c
    .. snippet-source:: examples/commercial-features/CF-EST-PKCS11/src/main.c

        static const char *est_crts_address_gen(void *arg,
                                                const void *x509_der_data,
                                                size_t x509_der_data_size) {
            (void) x509_der_data;
            (void) x509_der_data_size;

            char *buf = (char *) arg;
            sprintf(buf, "pkcs11:token=MyToken;object=CaCert%d;pin-value=1234", rand());
            return buf;
        }

  * The example function generates the addresses based on a random number;
    however, the actual DER-encoded certificate is passed to this function as
    well so that you may choose to generate the address based on the contents of
    the certificate

  * The returned string is copied by the library, so reusing the same buffer for
    multiple calls is OK. See `anjay_est_engine_cacert_address_gen_t
    <../api/core_8h.html#ae8604feaa669414289ed99d75a03d6fb>`_ for details on
    this callback's semantics.

.. note::

    You may specify only some of the above arguments, and leave others as
    ``NULL``. Software handling will be used for any credentials for which
    hardware engine addresses are not provided.

HSM-based EST and persistence
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When using hardware security engine for EST, the persistence stream will only
contain references (addresses) to the security credentials stored there.

The EST module manages the lifecycle of these credentials, so that old ones are
automatically removed when e.g. a new certificate is re-enrolled.

.. important::

    To ensure that the credentials stored on the HSM and the references in the
    persistence stream are kept in sync, **all EST-related security credentials
    stored in the HSM will be removed from it** when cleaning up the Anjay
    object, unless there have been no changes to them since the last call to
    ``anjay_est_state_persist()`` or ``anjay_est_state_restore()``.
