Migrating from Anjay 3.0
========================

.. contents:: :local:

.. highlight:: c

Introduction
------------

Since Anjay 3.0, some minor changes to the API has been done. These change are
breaking in the strictest sense, but in practice should not require any changes
to user code in typical usage.

Changes in Anjay proper
-----------------------

Behavior of anjay_attr_storage_restore() upon failure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Deprecated behavior of ``anjay_attr_storage_restore()`` which did clear the
Attribute Storage if supplied source stream was invalid has been changed. From
now on, if this function fails, the Attribute Storage remains untouched.
This change is breaking for code which relied on the old behavior, although
such code is unlikely.

Default (D)TLS version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the `anjay_configuration_t::dtls_version
<../api/structanjay__configuration.html#ab32477e7370a36e02db5b7e7ccbdd89d>`_
field is set to ``AVS_NET_SSL_VERSION_DEFAULT`` (which includes the case of
zero-initialization), Anjay 3.0 and earlier automatically mapped this setting to
``AVS_NET_SSL_VERSION_TLSv1_2`` to ensure that (D)TLS 1.2 is used as mandated by
the LwM2M specification.

This mapping has been removed in Anjay 3.1, which means that the default version
configuration of the underlying (D)TLS library will be used. This has been done
to automatically allow the use of newer protocols and deprecate old versions
when the backend library is updated, without the need to update Anjay code.
However, depending on the (D)TLS backend library used, this may lead to (D)TLS
1.1 or earlier being used if the server does not properly negotiate a higher
version. Please explicitly set ``dtls_version`` to
``AVS_NET_SSL_VERSION_TLSv1_2`` if you want to disallow this.

Please note that Mbed TLS 3.0 has dropped support for TLS 1.1 and earlier, so
this change will not affect behavior with that library.


Changes in avs_coap
-------------------

Changed flow of cancelling observations in case of errors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CoAP observations are implicitly cancelled if a notification bearing a 4.xx or
5.xx error code is delivered.

In Anjay 3.4.x and earlier, this cancellation (which involves calling the
``avs_coap_observe_cancel_handler_t`` callback) was performed *before* calling
the ``avs_coap_delivery_status_handler_t`` callback for the specific
notification. Since Anjay 3.5.0, this order is reversed, so any code that relies
on this logic may break.

This change is only relevant if you are using ``avs_coap`` APIs directly (e.g.
when communicating over raw CoAP protocol) and in case of notifications intended
to be delivered as confirmable. The LwM2M Observe/Notify implementation in Anjay
has been updated accordingly.

Changes in avs_commons
----------------------

Refactor of time handling in avs_sched and avs_coap
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is now enforced more strictly that time-based events shall happen when the
clock reaches *at least* the expected value. Previously, the tasks scheduled via
avs_sched were executed only when the clock reached a value *later* than the
scheduled job execution time.

This change will have no impact on your code if your platform has enough clock
resolution so that two subsequent calls to ``avs_time_real_now()`` or
``avs_time_monotonic_now()`` will *always* return different values. As a rule of
thumb, this should be the case if your clock has a resolution no worse than
about 1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than the CPU clock. For example, for a
100 MHz CPU, a clock resolution of around 100-1000 ns (i.e., 1-10 MHz) should be
sufficient, depending on the specific architecture.

If your clock has a lower resolution, you may observe the following changes:

* ``anjay_sched_run()`` is now properly guaranteed to execute at least one job
  if the time reported by ``anjay_sched_time_to_next()`` passed. Previously this
  could require waiting for another change of the numerical value of the clock,
  which could cause undesirable active waiting in the event loop. This is the
  motivating factor in introducing these changes.
* Jobs scheduled using ``AVS_SCHED_NOW()`` during an execution of
  ``anjay_sched_run()`` before the numerical value of the clock changes, *will*
  be executed during the same run. The previous behavior more strictly enforced
  the policy to not execute such jobs in the same run.

If you are scheduling custom jobs through the avs_sched module, you may want or
need to modify their logic accordingly to accommodate for these changes. In most
typical use cases, no changes are expected to be necessary.

Removal of avs_unit_memstream
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``avs_unit_memstream`` was a specific implementation of ``avs_stream_t`` within
the avs_unit module that implemented a simple FIFO stream in a fixed-size memory
area.

This feature has been removed. Instead, you can use an
``avs_stream_inbuf``/``avs_stream_outbuf`` pair, or an ``avs_stream_membuf``
object.
