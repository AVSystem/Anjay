Enterprise-grade commercial support for the Anjay library, as well as additional
commercially-licensed library features, are provided by AVSystem. For more
details, see
`AVSystem Anjay website <https://avsystem.com/anjay-iot-sdk/>`_.

If you want to test your LwM2M client implementation you can use the LwM2M
interoperability test module in AVSystem’s `Coiote IoT Device Management
<https://avsystem.com/coiote-iot-device-management-platform/>`_ platform. Our
automated tests and testing scenarios enable you to quickly check how
interoperable your device is with LwM2M. The tests include basic actions, such
as Read, Write, Execute, Discover, Delete, and more as well as advanced actions,
such as Loop or Wait to build more complex test cases. What’s more, you can also
create your own test scenarios or have us prepare custom test cases upon your
request. Visit our `webpage
<https://avsystem.com/coiote-iot-device-management-platform/lwm2m-interoperability-test/>`_
to learn more.

Commercial library features can be included separately as options accessible
on top of the basic functionality present in the open source version. Currently
available commercial features are:
