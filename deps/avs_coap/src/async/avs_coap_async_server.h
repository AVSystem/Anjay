 *
 * @param on_new_request_arg Opaque argument to pass to @p on_new_request .
 *
 * @param out_exchange       Pointer to a variable that will be set to a pointer
 *                           to the exchange for which the request handler needs
 *                           to be called, or to <c>NULL</c> if there is no such
 *                           exchange.
 *
 *                           This function will never set <c>*out_exchange</c>
 *                           to non-NULL and return nonzero code at the same
