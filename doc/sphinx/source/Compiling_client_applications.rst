Compiling client applications
=============================

Compiling the library
---------------------

Anjay uses CMake for project configuration. To compile the library with default settings:

.. code-block:: bash

    cmake . && make


Cross-compiling
---------------

ARM Cortex-M3-powered STM3220
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, prepare a CMake toolchain file (see `CMake documentation <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/manual/cmake-toolchains.7.html#cross-compiling>`_), then pass :code:`CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` when configuring Anjay:

.. code-block:: bash

    cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$YOUR_TOOLCHAIN_FILE . && make

An example CMake toolchain file for an ARM Cortex-M3-powered STM3220 platform may look like so:

.. code-block:: cmake

    set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Generic)
    set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION 1)

    set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER arm-none-eabi-gcc)

    # CMAKE_C_FLAGS set in a toolchain file get overwritten by CMakeCInformation.cmake
    # unless they are FORCEfully set in the cache
    # See http://stackoverflow.com/a/30217088/2339636
    unset(CMAKE_C_FLAGS CACHE)
    set(CMAKE_C_FLAGS "-mcpu=cortex-m3 -mthumb -msoft-float -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections -fno-common -fmessage-length=0 -std=gnu99 --specs=nosys.specs" CACHE STRING "" FORCE)

    set(CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS "-Wl,-gc-sections")


Android
~~~~~~~

Compliation on Android platform is rather straightforward. First you have to get `Android NDK
<https://developer.android.com/ndk/index.html>`_. To configure Anjay you
have to pass ``CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`` from the NDK (we assume that
``ANDROID_NDK`` variable contains a path to the folder where Android NDK
is extracted):

.. code-block:: bash

    cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$ANDROID_NDK/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake \
          -DDTLS_BACKEND="" \
          -DANDROID_ALLOW_UNDEFINED_SYMBOLS=ON \
          -DANDROID_PLATFORM=android-18 \
          -DANDROID_ABI=armeabi .

After that Anjay can be compiled as usual via `make`.

.. note::

    Android platforms older than `android-18` are not supported.


.. note::

    ``ANDROID_ALLOW_UNDEFINED_SYMBOLS`` is set, so that unresolved symbols
    required by the `libanjay.so` are not reported during the linking
    stage. They shall be resolved by providing dependencies to the final
    exectuable as it is illustrated in the next section.

Note that we did not set any ``DTLS_BACKEND`` and therefore Anjay is compiled
without DTLS support. To enable DTLS support you have to provide a value
to ``DTLS_BACKEND`` (see `README.md <https://github.com/AVSystem/Anjay>`_
for more details) along with specific variable indicating where the required
DTLS libraries are to be found, i.e. one of:

    - ``OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR`` (as `FindOpenSSL.cmake` suggests),
    - ``MBEDTLS_ROOT_DIR``,
    - ``TINYDTLS_ROOT_DIR``

depending on the chosen backend.

.. topic:: Example compilation with mbed TLS backend

    First, we compile mbed TLS on Android:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ git clone https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls -b mbedtls-2.5.0
        $ cd mbedtls
        $ cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$ANDROID_NDK/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake \
                -DANDROID_PLATFORM=android-18 \
                -DANDROID_ABI=armeabi \
                -DENABLE_TESTING=OFF \
                -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/tmp/mbedtls/install .
        $ make
        $ make install

    We then go back to the Anjay source directory, to reconfigure Anjay to use
    mbed TLS binaries (we strongly suggest to clean all kind of CMake caches
    before proceeding, as it may not work otherwise):

    .. code-block:: bash

        cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$ANDROID_NDK/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake \
              -DDTLS_BACKEND="mbedtls" \
              -DMBEDTLS_ROOT_DIR=/tmp/mbedtls/install \
              -DANDROID_ALLOW_UNDEFINED_SYMBOLS=ON \
              -DANDROID_PLATFORM=android-18 \
              -DANDROID_ABI=armeabi .

    And finally, we run `make`, finishing the whole procedure.


Installing the library
----------------------

To install Anjay headers and libraries in :code:`/usr/local`:

.. code-block:: bash

    cmake . && make && sudo make install

A custom installation prefix may be set using :code:`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`:

.. code-block:: bash

    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/custom/path . && make && make install


Including the library in an application
---------------------------------------

CMake projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The preferred method of using Anjay in custom projects is to use CMake :code:`find_package` command after installing the library:

.. code-block:: cmake

    find_package(anjay)
    include_directories(${ANJAY_INCLUDE_DIRS})
    target_link_libraries(my_executable ${ANJAY_LIBRARIES}) # or ANJAY_LIBRARIES_STATIC for a static library

.. note::

    If a custom installation path is used, you need to set :code:`anjay_DIR` CMake variable to :code:`$YOUR_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib/anjay`.


Alternative build systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For other build systems, necessary flags can be retrieved using :code:`cmake` command:

.. code-block:: bash

    cmake --find-package -DNAME=anjay -DLANGUAGE=C -DCOMPILER_ID=Generic -DMODE=<mode>

Where :code:`<mode>` is one of:

- :code:`EXIST` - check whether the library can be found,
- :code:`COMPILE` - print compilation flags,
- :code:`LINK` - print linking arguments.

.. note::

	If a custom installation prefix is used, you need to also pass :code:`-Danjay_DIR=$YOUR_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib/anjay`.
