.. note::

    This section explains manual implementation of custom objects. If the
    object you wish to implement is a standard one, registered in `OMA LwM2M
    Object and Resource Registry
    <http://www.openmobilealliance.org/wp/OMNA/LwM2M/LwM2MRegistry.html>`_,
    you can generate Anjay object stub from the Object Definition XML with
    :ref:`anjay-object-stub-generator`.

    We still encourage you to read the tutorial to have a clear understanding
    on what various parts of the LwM2M object code are for.
